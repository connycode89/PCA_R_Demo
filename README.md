# PCA_R_Demo
A demo of PCA I prepared in R Shiny about 4 years ago in 2016

- The "My PCA Shiny" folder contains a R Project for RStudio called "My PCA Shiny App"
- Inside this folder, I also have the server and ui files
- The Height.Weight.csv file is sample data you can upload to the Shiny application - this has a small number of made up Height and Weight numbers
